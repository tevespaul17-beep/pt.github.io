Place your supplied profile image file here and name it exactly: assets/profile.jpg

- Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png
- Recommended size: square, ~800x800 or larger for good quality.
- Web-friendly optimization: use an exported "Save for Web" or a compressed export to keep file size small (under ~300KB if possible).

After placing the image, reload project.html in the browser. The profile image will appear in the card. If you prefer a PNG, rename the file to `profile.png` and update the `src` in project.html accordingly.
